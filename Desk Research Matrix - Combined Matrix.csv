"AATI + TASC

Notebook",Governance,"[Clear Mandates] ATx models are typically established with clear mandates that encompass analytical studies, implementation of priority projects, provision of implementation support, and fostering linkages and coordination among agricultural and related institutions. The specific goal of the AATI, for instance, is to build and coordinate effective and sustainable delivery mechanisms that can implement policies to facilitate agricultural and food systems transformation.

[Institutional Autonomy] Some ATx models, like the Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) in its initial phase and the Togo ATA, were designed as standalone institutions or independent legal agencies outside traditional government structures. This design fosters operational flexibility and a culture of innovation and high performance. The Ethiopian ATA was accountable to a Transformation Council chaired by the Prime Minister, allowing it significant operational independence.

[Nodal Agency Model] The underlying concept for many ATx models is the ""nodal agency,"" aiming to create a highly competent bureaucracy with significant power, authority, technical competence, and insulation to effectively shape economic development, specifically agricultural transformation.

[Evidence-Based Approach] ATx models are fundamentally designed to promote and utilize evidence-based decision-making. They leverage analytics, data, and diagnostics to inform strategies and policy, contributing to a stronger culture of evidence-based approaches in government.

[Co-creation] Initiatives like the AATI emphasize a co-creation process with country governments for designing support models and initiatives, ensuring alignment with local needs and demand. This demand-driven approach helps to avoid creating parallel structures and ensures government demand and political support.

[Multi-stakeholder Platforms] ATx entities actively establish and leverage multi-stakeholder platforms (e.g., Transformation Council, National Steering Committees, Value Chain Alliances) to coordinate various actors, facilitate discussions, and foster ownership of agricultural transformation initiatives.

[High-Level Political Sponsorship] The ability of ATx entities to report to high-level political leadership (e.g., Prime Minister's or President's Office) provides direct access to decision-makers and often facilitates the resolution of systemic bottlenecks and inter-ministerial conflicts. This political backing is a key source of their influence.","[Mandate Shifts] Changes in government vision or political leadership can lead to unpredictable shifts in the ATx mandate and reporting lines, potentially reducing their influence and focus. For instance, the Ethiopian ATA's reporting line moved from the Prime Minister's Office to the Ministry of Agriculture and then to the State Minister, and its mandate shifted towards a primary focus on studies as an ""Institute,"" losing its time-bound urgency.

[Blurred Internal Roles] The delineation of roles between different internal functions, such as analytics and delivery, within an ATx can become blurred and unclear, which may hinder operational effectiveness.

[Bureaucratic Constraints] If an ATx is established merely as an administrative unit within existing government bureaucracy, it can face difficulties attracting and retaining high-caliber staff due to limitations inherent in government employment structures.

[Parallel Structure Risk] There is a continuous risk that an ATx, if not carefully integrated and co-designed with existing government structures, could inadvertently create parallel structures that duplicate efforts and lead to inefficiencies.

[Slow Implementation] The reliance on traditional grant modalities, especially when funds are channeled through National Treasuries, can lead to significant delays in implementation, as re-allocation to sector ministries might be prolonged.

[Dual Reporting Challenges] For ATx personnel directly hired by a central initiative like the AATI, a dual reporting line (to the central unit and potentially to local ministers) can create conflicts in adherence to mandate and challenges in reporting on achievements, particularly when ministers choose their own ATx Directors.

[Competing Strategies] The existence of competing strategic documents within a country's government (e.g., Tanzania's ASDP II and Agriculture Master Plan) can create internal political tensions and limit an ATx's ability to effectively advance agricultural transformation efforts.

[Lack of Consensus Mechanisms] Some ATx models may struggle to develop in-built mechanisms for creating sustainable consensus across various institutions and individuals, making them vulnerable to shifts in political priorities and hindering continuity.","[Successful Replication] The documented successes and lessons learned from established ATx models, such as the Ethiopian ATA, provide a valuable blueprint for the establishment and scaling of similar delivery mechanisms in other African countries.

[Flexible Adaptation] Initiatives like the AATI have the opportunity to adopt a modular and flexible design approach, allowing them to tailor their support offerings and governance models to the specific needs, existing structures, and political contexts of individual countries.

[National Plan Alignment] ATx models can be strategically positioned to integrate their approaches with national development plans and strategies, ensuring alignment with broader government priorities and leveraging existing frameworks (e.g., Ethiopia's Agricultural Commercialization Clusters (ACC) approach integrated into the 10-year development plan, and IFAD's Country Strategic Opportunities Program (COSOP) aligning with Ethiopia's 10-year plan).

[Digital Transformation] Leveraging digital tools and enhanced data systems offers a significant opportunity to improve real-time decision-making, increase efficiency in governance, and support policy-making (e.g., Kenya's Digital Food Balance Sheet, Sierra Leone's prioritization of digital data systems).

[Structured Planning] Implementing structured work planning processes within ATx offices can enhance realism and implementability of initiatives, thereby facilitating more effective decision-making and project execution.

[Cross-Learning] Organizing learning retreats and comparative reviews of different delivery models (e.g., ATA, ATO, Food Security War Rooms) provides an opportunity for cross-learning and peer exchange, contributing to the development of best-practice, context-specific modular frameworks for agricultural delivery.","[Political Turnover] Frequent changes in political leadership or shifts in government priorities represent a significant external risk that can undermine the sustainability and effectiveness of ATx models, especially if their influence is deeply tied to specific political champions.

[Ministerial Resistance] Resistance from existing ministries or government bodies to the establishment or integration of a delivery unit can pose a considerable obstacle to its success, particularly if they perceive the ATx as a competitor or an external imposition.

[Host Organization Friction] The administrative and legal frameworks of a central host organization (e.g., IFAD for AATI) can create operational challenges and friction for the ATx to operate optimally, impacting key functions like recruitment and agreement signatures.

[Reputational Damage] Raising expectations in countries for extensive support, particularly the establishment of full-fledged ATx offices, without following through on the commitment, can lead to reputational risks for the ATx initiative and its founding partners.

[Fragmented Support] A potential threat is contributing to further fragmentation of country-level development support, especially in an already crowded space of policy and delivery advisory. Ensuring complementarity and avoiding overlap with existing actors is crucial for success.

[Ad-hoc Engagement] A shift from regular, structured engagements to more ad-hoc meetings with senior leadership can significantly reduce an ATx's influence and impact on decision-making and coordination within the agricultural sector."

Notebook",Analytics,"[Evidence-Based Mandate] The African Agricultural Transformation Initiative (AATI) aims to fill the gap between strategy formulation and implementation by building, supporting, and coordinating effective and sustainable delivery mechanisms that prioritize food systems transformation, inclusion, and sustainability. A key objective is to improve government delivery capacity and capability by fostering a stronger culture of evidence-based decision-making. The Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA), now the Agricultural Transformation Institute (ATI), built its reputation as a ""think-tank"" capable of producing world-class analytical output across commodities and value chains, which expanded to its role as a systems integrator and implementer.

[Integrated M&E Systems] The AATI explicitly includes as an intermediary outcome the improvement and successful implementation of Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) capabilities within the agriculture sector, alongside increased digital capabilities and usage of tools. This involves setting up data dashboards, M&E frameworks, and established feedback loops to inform future policymaking. Analysts in both the national Agricultural Transformation Offices (ATOs)/ATAs and the central AATI team are dedicated to improving M&E capabilities and aggregating data for the entire initiative, ensuring transparency.

[Advanced Analytical Toolkit] The AATI partners leverage a variety of specialized tools and expertise to enhance agricultural transformation. This includes the International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI) Rural Investment and Policy Analysis (RIAPA) modeling tool for economy-wide analyses and policy assessment, the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy's (BFAP) market-led policy and value chain analysis, and McKinsey & Company's ACRE (agricultural advanced-analytics center) for geospatial analytics. The AATI is also developing a Country-Budget Tool for Food Systems Transformation and exploring a True Value of Food (TVOF) tool. The Ethiopian ATA (now ATI) implemented a national digital soil fertility mapping system (EthioSIS), which provided tailored fertilizer recommendations and spurred over $3 billion in private investment.

[Knowledge Hub Development] A core aim of the AATI is to increase awareness and disseminate knowledge on successful models, tools, and approaches for agricultural delivery across sub-Saharan Africa. This involves creating a knowledge and best practice repository covering strategy formulation, institution building, and flagship project delivery. The AATI plans learning retreats to compare different delivery models (ATA, ATO, Food Security War Rooms) and develop a best-practice, context-specific modular framework for agricultural delivery, with processes documented as templates and standard operating procedures.

[Problem-Solving Approach] The Ethiopian ATA's approach since its inception has been characterized by a problem-solving mindset, swift action, and a focus on identifying systemic bottlenecks to catalyze transformation. The ATI’s Analytics Team operates like an international strategy consulting firm, providing action-oriented studies to identify systemic bottlenecks and design solutions.

[Digital Extension Services] The Ethiopian ATI has significantly advanced digital agriculture through initiatives like the 8028 Farmer Hotline, which provides tailored advice on 21 crops in five languages to millions of users, demonstrating effective dissemination of agricultural information. They also developed the Digital Agricultural Roadmap (DAR).","[Inconsistent Data Utilization] While tools exist, embedding data into daily decision-making rhythms requires identifying key decisions, knowing who makes them, and ensuring timely access and use of data. For the nascent ATOs in Tanzania and Sierra Leone, project management and reporting are still largely manual, relying on Excel and Word documents, indicating a significant need to digitize M&E and reporting frameworks. Tanzania's ATO workplan submission initially did not align with the AATI's MEL Framework, proposing activities not supported by IFAD.

[Data Gaps for Evaluation] Independent evaluations, such as the FAO's assessment of the Ethiopian ATA, highlighted a lack of comprehensive, representative data at the project and household levels, which limited the rigor of impact assessments and the ability to isolate causal links. Specifically, the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) used was not fully representative of ATA's intervention areas, and data on certain priority crops was sparse.

[Shift from Analytics Focus (Togo)] In Togo, the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) de-prioritized analytics from its design phase, shifting its focus entirely to delivery and implementation, moving away from the more analytics- and strategy-focused model of the Ethiopian ATA. This meant that embedded support staff from TASC ended up leading an Implementation Cluster rather than an Analytics Team.

[Capacity Transfer Challenges] There's a risk that national ATAs may become over-reliant on central AATI teams, hindering the development of their own sustainable capabilities. While the AATI focuses on capability building, ensuring full transfer of roles and responsibilities to local actors, and increasing governmental financial contributions over time, remain crucial for long-term sustainability.

[Resource Allocation Resistance] In Tanzania, government officials expressed concerns regarding the recruitment process and planned budget for a Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) Hub, preferring resources be allocated directly to farmers rather than to external consultants. This indicates potential internal resistance to how analytical and technical support resources are managed and distributed.","[Leveraging Partner Expertise] The AATI is poised to leverage existing tools and analyses from key partners like IFPRI, MAFAP, and BFAP for sector-wide diagnostics and policy analyses. These collaborations offer strong potential for enhancing policy recommendations, defining flagship priorities, and designing effective delivery infrastructures. The multi-lateral, public, and not-for-profit nature of AATI's partners facilitates the free dissemination of tools and approaches.

[Digitalization Momentum] The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the drive for digitalization in agriculture, particularly in managing food reserves. Kenya's Agricultural Transformation Office (ATO) successfully leveraged the crisis to implement data-driven tools like the Digital Food Balance Sheet (DFBS) to improve real-time decision-making, which can be a model for other countries. McKinsey's digital lab can support the development of customized digital tools for governments and smallholder farmers.

[Cross-Learning and Replication] The AATI's central unit aims to facilitate the replication of common design principles and best practices across national ATAs, fostering a knowledge hub of successful approaches and tools. This systematic approach to learning and sharing aims to induce a sustainable ""chain-effect"" of agricultural transformations throughout Africa by building a library of replicable models. The planned learning retreat further underscores this commitment to cross-country knowledge exchange.

[Demand-Driven Adaptation] The AATI's flexible support model, offering both grants and direct implementation, allows it to respond expediently to recipient governments' needs and preferences, enhancing engagement and minimizing delays. This demand-driven approach helps co-create tailored support based on specific country needs and existing delivery mechanisms.","[Political Volatility] Changes in political leadership pose a significant threat to the long-term sustainability and impact of ATx models by potentially leading to discontinuities in strategies and priorities. For instance, a change in Prime Minister in Ethiopia led to the dissolution of the Transformation Council and a shift in accountability for the ATA. In Sudan, political instability and power struggles were identified as hindrances to the development of an ATA-like institution.

[Risk of Fragmentation] The landscape of development support in Africa is crowded with numerous organizations providing policy and delivery advice, raising the risk that the AATI could contribute to further fragmentation of efforts. AATI emphasizes the need to actively collaborate and seek complementarities with existing initiatives rather than competing with them.

[Resistance to External Models] Local governments may view externally proposed delivery institutions with wariness, perceiving them as potentially competing with existing ministries' efforts. In Ghana, resistance within the Ministry of Agriculture to the establishment of a Delivery Unit was a significant obstacle to engagement.

[Unequal Benefit Distribution] While ATx models aim for broad impact and poverty reduction, there is a risk that interventions primarily focused on ""market-oriented producers"" may disproportionately benefit ""better off"" farmers, potentially leaving more resource-constrained or poorer smallholders behind. This suggests a need for differentiated strategies to ensure a more inclusive transformation.

[Financial Sustainability Concerns] The sustainability of ATx models relies on increasing financial contributions from national governments over time, reducing dependence on donor funding. If governments do not progressively assume the costs, the long-term viability of these delivery units could be compromised."

Notebook",Political–Managerial Balance,"[High-Level Political Sponsorship] Agricultural transformation initiatives are designed to have strong political backing and senior government ownership, often reporting to the Prime Minister or President, which provides significant influence and operational independence. This high-level engagement ensures that the initiative is recognized as a national priority and can ""cut through"" bureaucracy.

[Core Technical Focus] There is a commitment to preserving a technical and data-driven focus for the transformation entities, emphasizing the value of maintaining these foundational principles even through leadership changes. This focus is bolstered by strong in-house analytical skills and a flexible approach to staffing.

[Formal Institutionalization] The establishment of these agencies or offices through formal decrees or regulations (e.g., by the Council of Ministers or Presidential decrees) grants them a legal mandate and institutional presence, contributing to their perceived legitimacy, longevity, and authority.","[Vulnerability to Leadership Change] Changes in political leadership can undermine the continuity and influence of agricultural transformation efforts. For example, the Ethiopian ATA experienced a reduction in access to the Prime Minister's office and overall influence after a new PM was elected.

[Diminished Authority] The delegation of reporting lines to lower ministerial levels can significantly reduce the influence and impact of the transformation institution within the broader agriculture sector.

[Operational Control vs. Autonomy] When support modalities shift to direct implementation (e.g., AATI hiring ATO personnel directly), it can create dual reporting lines where locally appointed directors may not fully align with the central initiative's mandate, hindering effective reporting on achievements.

[Internal Strategy Conflicts] The presence of competing strategic documents or parallel initiatives from different partners (e.g., in Tanzania, ASDP II vs. the Agriculture Master Plan) can create internal divides and political tensions within the government, impeding progress in agricultural transformation.

[Reputational Damage] Raising expectations for full-fledged support in countries that are not subsequently fulfilled can lead to reputational risks for the initiating organization and its partners.","[Model Replication & Adaptation] Drawing lessons from established successful models, such as the Ethiopian ATA, can inform the design and implementation of new agricultural transformation initiatives in other countries, particularly concerning the criticality of strong political commitment and a clear mandate.

[Tailored Support Flexibility] Adopting flexible support models (e.g., offering grants or direct implementation based on country preference) allows the initiative to adapt to specific governmental needs and preferences, potentially expediting engagements with recipient governments.

[Enhanced Cross-Sectoral Integration] Positioning delivery units to collaborate across various ministries (e.g., Agriculture, Irrigation, Finance, Trade) presents an opportunity to strengthen cross-sectoral coordination and foster a more integrated approach to agricultural transformation.

[Strengthening Evidence-Based Governance] The development and utilization of robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks, digital tools, and analytical capabilities can enhance evidence-based policy formulation and decision-making, thereby strengthening the influence of technocratic leadership.","[Political Instability] Significant political upheavals, such as coups, can abruptly halt the establishment and operation of transformation agencies, completely derailing ongoing efforts, as evidenced by the Sudan ALTA initiative.

[Bureaucratic Resistance] Resistance or wariness from existing government ministries or civil servants towards external delivery institutions can pose considerable obstacles to the successful establishment and functioning of new transformation units.

[Staffing Volatility] Internal government processes regarding recruitment or reassignment of personnel can negatively impact the staffing levels and stability of delivery units, potentially limiting their operational capacity and effectiveness.

[Financial Delays] Delays in the reallocation of funds from national treasuries to sector-specific ministries, or other internal financial constraints, can impede the timely implementation of programs and operations."

Notebook",Sustainability & Resilience,"[Capacity Building Focus] The African Agricultural Transformation Initiative (AATI) aims to promote greater sustainability and transferability of support structures by focusing on capability building of local players and long-term ownership, including digital and leadership capabilities. This includes formal training sessions and on-the-ground day-to-day learning.

[Replicable Models] The AATI aims to generate a wave of delivery mechanisms across Africa, cascading successful operating models (principles, practices, and processes) from one country to another. Building a library of successful and transferable approaches can induce a sustainable ""chain-effect"" of agricultural transformations throughout Africa.

[Problem-Solving Approach] The Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA)'s support was characterized by a problem-solving mindset, swift action, the inclusion of gender-sensitive approaches, and enhanced stakeholder coordination.

[Permanent Institutional Status] The Ethiopian ATI transitioned from an agency with an initial 20-year time limit to a permanent institute in December 2021, establishing it as a permanent institution and re-emphasizing strategy and policy in its mandate.

[Tailored Local Ownership] The support model is adapted to specific country needs and builds upon existing structures, emphasizing high local ownership and long-term sustainability of activities. National Agricultural Transformation Agencies (ATAs) are intended to be the main drivers of their countries' transformation agendas.

[Leveraging Partner Expertise] The AATI will leverage its partners' expertise in designing gender transformative programs and governance models, as well as policies that strengthen environmental sustainability and climate resilience. IFAD's extensive experience in impact evaluations and its system of gender markers contribute to this.

[Agile Learning & Adaptation] The ATA has been highly agile and action-oriented, quickly learning from its studies and pilots and incorporating them into subsequent interventions. The AATI blueprint, which guides the establishment of Agricultural Transformation Offices (ATOs), is a dynamic document updated regularly with learnings from supported countries. AATI also supports the co-design of ideas with government officials, significantly strengthening knowledge management.

[Internal Demand Creation] Successful ATA models are expected to create internal demand for the establishment of such delivery units within host governments, which in turn makes external funding less critical and, in the long run, potentially obsolete.","[External Support Dependence] National ATAs may over-rely on support from central AATI teams and not sufficiently develop their own capabilities to sustainably carry the initiative forward.

[Farmer Resource Gaps] Small producers often face constraints like limited access to land, household labor, improved seeds, agrochemicals, and credit, which can hinder technology adoption and imply risk aversion, limiting the scaling up of interventions.

[Policy Operationalization Gaps] The implementation of new fertilizer recommendations (e.g., EthioSIS) may face challenges, with ongoing use of older blends due to factors like market availability, liquidity constraints, and farmer risk aversion. This indicates that new recommendations may not be fully operationalized across all areas.

[Practice Adoption Lag] Although crop rotation is cited as a component of the Agricultural Commercialization Clusters (ACC) strategy, its implementation is in a nascent stage or unaffected by other ATA projects, partly due to diminishing farm sizes that constrain farmers' ability to subdivide plots for this practice.

[Political Buy-in Challenges] Experience in Tanzania showed difficulties in building and sustaining political buy-in and focused attention on agriculture development for delivery units.

[Implementation Bottlenecks] In Tanzania, the Agricultural Master Plan (AMP) faced delays in official launch and finalization of its project document due to parallel processes (e.g., ASDP II) and review by the National Economic Planning Commission, limiting AATI's ability to advance agricultural transformation efforts.

[Unmet Expectations Risk] AATI created a reputational risk by initiating high-level engagements and raising expectations in countries like Ghana and Nigeria, which were then not fully followed through with substantial support.

[Land Tenure Insecurity] In some contexts (e.g., Togo), a general lack of land security makes farmers hesitant to invest long-term in their fields.","[Growing Government Commitment] Africa's agricultural transformation is gaining momentum, with an increased number of countries committing to potential actions beyond strategy formulation and expressing willingness to enhance coordination and create a favorable enabling environment for transformation.

[Flexible Support Models] The AATI's flexible support model (allowing for grants versus direct implementation) has enabled the Initiative to expedite its engagements with recipient governments based on their specific needs and preferences, overcoming potential delays associated with channeling funds through national treasuries.

[Climate Integration Focus] The AATI blueprint for establishing Agricultural Transformation Offices integrates Climate Hubs as an integral part of its value proposition, explicitly addressing the crucial nexus between agriculture and climate change.

[Cross-Country Learning] The AATI aims to support a mix of countries with varying readiness levels and starting points to generate a range of insights. A planned learning retreat will conduct a comparative review of different delivery models to contribute to a best-practice, context-specific modular framework for agricultural delivery.

[Strengthened Private Sector Engagement] National ATAs are mandated to strengthen ties with the private sector, recognizing them as important drivers for economically sustainable solutions and job creation. This can be achieved through general mechanisms (e.g., roundtables, investment funnels) and targeted flagship initiatives.

[Standardized Metrics for Inclusion] The AATI's results framework incorporates key indicators like the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEIA) and the Climate Resilience Outcome Approach by the EBRD to ensure that flagship programs effectively target inclusion and climate resilience.

[Diverse Funding Sources] The ATO in Tanzania is actively developing project proposals to secure funding from various international and national sources (e.g., Norwegian Embassy, AfDB, African Capacity Building Foundation) to address budget gaps and promote youth-led agribusiness ventures. Partnerships with organizations like the Syngenta Foundation and Food Action Alliance are also being explored for resource mobilization.","[Political Volatility] Changes in political leadership and broader political instability (e.g., coups, as seen in Sudan) can create discontinuities that undermine the sustainability of impact and lead to a loss of sustained political backing, which was a challenge for the Ethiopian ATA.

[Lack of Sustained Commitment] The success of the initiative is highly dependent on sustained government commitment, which can be challenging to build and maintain over time, as highlighted by experiences in Tanzania.

[Development Fragmentation] The policy support and delivery advisory space in Africa is crowded, posing a risk of further fragmentation of country-level development support. The AATI aims to mitigate this by complementing rather than competing with existing players' activities.

[External Shocks] Global challenges such as climate change and geopolitical instability can exacerbate food insecurity and divert government attention and commitment away from agricultural transformation efforts.

[Data & Causality Limitations] The lack of an experimental framework and longitudinal household-level data for impact assessment means caution is needed when making strong causal claims regarding the broader impacts of interventions.

[Inconsistent Data Collection] Detailed data on organic input use can be challenging to gather consistently across regions, which could hinder comprehensive and comparable progress tracking for certain sustainability indicators."

Notebook",Catalytic Impact,"[Holistic Approach] The African Agricultural Transformation Initiative (AATI) aims to bridge the gap between agriculture strategy formulation and execution through tailored support models, focusing on providing institutional support for flagship implementation and delivery. Its overall objective is to build and coordinate effective and sustainable delivery mechanisms that can implement policies to facilitate agricultural transformation and prioritize food systems transformation, inclusion, and sustainability across sub-Saharan African countries. Agricultural Transformation Delivery Units (AT DUs) unpack the requirements of agricultural transformation, identify priority interventions, and establish transformation agendas or design flagship projects specifically aimed at enabling agricultural transformation. They complement line ministries by focusing on introducing change and resolving issues that arise during such processes.

[Capacity Building] AATI builds the capacity of delivery units and supports their movement to action, including developing tools and capabilities for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and digital tools. AATI's primary goal is to build government's capacity and ability to successfully deliver on agricultural transformations on the ground, by establishing local delivery mechanisms and supporting their acceleration. This encompasses ensuring a strong agriculture strategy, fostering a conducive institutional delivery setting, and developing required leadership capabilities and mindsets. The ATI (formerly ATA) strengthened institutional capacities through collaborative efforts and capacity-building training, while also improving its internal operations for efficient back-office services.

[Evidence-Based Decision-Making] AATI concretely defines flagships and policy priorities based on national strategic plans. The Ethiopian ATA, a model for AATI, explicitly emphasized evidence-based decision-making, producing significant knowledge and evidence on systemic bottlenecks and policy enhancements. This approach led to key initiatives like the Ethiopian Soil Information System (EthioSIS), which involved collecting over 150,000 soil samples to develop national digital soil fertility maps, providing tailored fertilizer recommendations and spurring over $3 billion in private investment. In Kenya, the Agricultural Transformation Office (ATO) leveraged the COVID-19 crisis to use data-driven tools for evidence-based decisions and accelerated food reserve management.

[Measurable Outcomes] AATI aims for target countries to have delivery mechanisms that translate plans into on-the-ground impact, with specific outcomes including the improvement of the Enabling Business of Agriculture (EBA) ranking by at least two points. The improvements in support provided by governments to rural people are expected to enhance productive capacity, leading to higher incomes, greater resilience to shocks, and lower poverty. The AATI uses a robust results measurement framework to track progress, incorporating metrics for women's empowerment (WEAI) and including indicators for climate resilience.

[Significant Economic Impact] The Ethiopian ATA, a key model for AATI, catalyzed a transformation that resulted in 6 million people moving out of poverty and the creation of 5 million more jobs in non-farm rural agriculture and non-ag sectors since 2010. An evaluation by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that the ATA contributed to a $1.7 billion increase in overall GDP, representing a return of more than 10 times the funds invested and an annualized rate of return of 289%, which is significantly higher than typically seen in development initiatives. The ATA's operations contributed to reducing the slowdown in Ethiopia's GDP growth.

[Increased Productivity] ATA interventions led to a significant increase in the likelihood of improved seed use (15 percentage points (pp) overall for the ACC initiative, 5.7 pp for teff, and 6.5 pp for wheat). There was also an increased likelihood of agrochemical use (10.3 pp nationally, and 17 pp for teff and 8.7 pp for barley through ACC), and an expansion in the use of organic and chemical fertilizers (18 pp and 23 pp respectively). These shifts were linked to yield improvements for priority crops, with wheat yields approximately doubling.

[Enhanced Commercialization] The ATA's work effectively removed market bottlenecks, leading to increased engagement with markets. The share of harvested output sold on the market grew significantly for teff (16 pp), and to a lesser extent for barley (1.8 pp), wheat (3.8 pp), and fruit-tree crops. This indicates that the ATA's support created a more favorable environment for producers to engage in value chains for marketable priority crops.

[Innovation Incubation] The ATI incubates, pilots, and scales up innovations to address systemic bottlenecks in Ethiopia’s agriculture sector. AT DUs are designed to introduce, test, and help put in place conditions for scaling up innovations and new approaches to public sector support for agriculture.

[Private Sector Engagement] National ATAs strengthen ties to the private sector, facilitating partnerships and investment funnels for flagship priorities. The Ethiopian ATA successfully attracted investments into agro-processing exceeding $3 billion. The ATI supported business-to-business networking for agri-enterprises at events like AGRIFEX 2023 and facilitated a $35 million investment request for a sesame and soybean processing plant.

[Inclusion Focus] AATI aims to ensure its benefits are inclusive of the most vulnerable and marginalized groups, with a strong emphasis on the inclusion of poor rural women and men. It promotes and tracks inclusion and gender equality, leveraging partners' expertise and measuring progress through metrics like the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI). Capacity building initiatives and policy engagement focused on gender have demonstrated a clear impact on increasing gender equality. The ACC program identified opportunities for engaging women and youth in agriculture, creating jobs for over 272,000 women and 158,000 young people in Ethiopia.

[Climate Resilience Integration] AATI ensures that climate resilience and sustainability remain at the forefront of flagship prioritization and delivery, with flagships targeting climate resilience and adaptation explicitly included in the results framework. The blueprint for ATOs now incorporates Climate Hubs as an integral part of its value proposition to provide an integrated approach to climate adaptation and mitigation in the agriculture sector.

[Adaptability] The AATI follows a modular design approach to tailor its support offering, timing, and governance model to specific country needs and existing landscapes. The support offering will be iteratively shaped by continuous learnings and adaptation as country needs evolve. The Togo ATA, for example, adapted its focus areas based on farmer needs, shifting its emphasis towards implementation over analytics and strategy to better align with on-the-ground realities.","[Implementation Delays] Ministers in some countries expressed concerns that AATI's support modality based on grants, especially if funds were channeled through national treasury, could lead to delays in implementing an ATO. They preferred direct implementation by AATI (recruiting personnel and procuring services) to expedite engagements.

[Data Gaps] The FAO evaluation of the Ethiopian ATA highlighted limitations due to a lack of comprehensive data at the project level, which limited the ability to identify impacts for each specific project. There are also ongoing issues with capturing gender and age-disaggregated data across AATI interventions for flagships in Tanzania, with the Agricultural Master Plan not yet launched for such monitoring.

[Sustainability Reliance] There is a risk that national ATAs may over-rely on support from central AATI teams and may not sufficiently develop their own capabilities for long-term sustainability. To mitigate this, funded positions are time-bound, and there's a strong focus on capability building to promote ownership.

[Uneven Impact] The impact of ATA interventions on teff yields was found to be negative overall for some producer typologies, masking heterogeneity and indicating that smaller producers or those with less diverse crop portfolios may face different constraints and benefit less significantly. The analysis suggests that ATA interventions disproportionately benefited ""better off"" or less risk-averse farmers.

[Insufficient Progress Tracking] In Tanzania, while the Agricultural Master Plan (AMP) flagships have budgets and cost planning, they lack resource mobilization plans, and the monitoring and evaluation of their impact on inclusion and climate adaptation/mitigation had not been launched as of late 2024.

[Scaling Constraints] Structural issues related to limited access to land and household labor have been identified as constraints for scaling up ATA's actions at the agricultural household level.

[Strategic Shift Challenges] The Togo ATA de-prioritized analytics in its August 2023 key decisions, shifting its primary focus to project delivery. This strategic choice might limit its capacity for comprehensive systemic problem identification and solution design, which is a core tenet of the Nodal Agency model initially envisioned.","[Learning Exchange] AATI aims to establish a knowledge hub of successful approaches and tools, enabling the replication of learnings from local delivery infrastructures to other countries across the continent. It plans to organize a learning retreat on agricultural delivery mechanisms to compare different models and identify best practices for context-specific modular frameworks.

[Expanded Partnerships] AATI is actively exploring and forming partnerships with a range of organizations, including the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), Mastercard Foundation, Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), the African Union, Syngenta Foundation, and Food Action Alliance. The goal is to identify synergies and leverage expertise and funding to drive agricultural transformation.

[Digitalization Potential] The COVID-19 pandemic provided impetus to modernize food reserves through digitalization, exemplified by Kenya's Digital Food Balance Sheet. AATI plans to roll out a program management tool (ASANA) to enhance efficiency in tracking and reporting progress for its initiatives. Digital solutions are becoming a bigger priority across the continent's agriculture portfolios.

[Policy Influence] IFPRI's Rural Investment and Policy Analysis (RIAPA) modeling tool offers a forward-looking, economy-wide analysis to simulate agricultural investments and assess their impacts on poverty reduction and economic transformation, providing a valuable tool for direct policy influence.

[Tailored Interventions] There is an opportunity to fine-tune future interventions to expand inclusiveness, tailoring strategies to the different needs of producers (e.g., based on gender or resource constraints) to maximize the uptake of modern practices. This includes exploring deeper micro-analysis of value chains and commodities to identify specific areas for targeted interventions.","[Political Instability/Turnover] Changes in political leadership can create discontinuities that undermine the sustainability of impact. The experience in Tanzania showed how difficult it can be to build and sustain delivery units, especially concerning consistent political buy-in. The coup in Sudan, for example, directly halted the creation of the Sudan Agriculture and Livestock Transformation Agency (ALTA), highlighting the significant risk of political instability.

[Fragile Political Buy-in] Lack of sustained political buy-in was a major factor contributing to the limited success of McKinsey's efforts in Tanzania's Agricultural Delivery Lab. Maintaining continuous and broad political buy-in across all levels of government and from non-state actors is crucial for the operational sustainability of ATx models.

[Fragmentation of Support] There is a risk that AATI's efforts could contribute to further fragmentation of country-level development support, as policy support and delivery advisory are already crowded spaces with many actors. AATI aims to mitigate this risk by complementing and coordinating efforts rather than competing with existing players.

[Raising Unmet Expectations] Raising expectations in countries for support that is not ultimately followed through creates a reputational risk for AATI and its founding partners, as observed in engagements with Ghana and Nigeria where initial interest was not sustained with full support.

[Demand vs. Supply Alignment] There may be important trade-offs in the adoption of different interventions promoted by ATx models, particularly if a shift to more commercially viable crops impacts household food security. The risk of food insecurity and malnutrition at the household level needs to be looked at in more detail in the future."

 [Improved Coordination/Capacity] The ET ATA helped improve the effective process to coordinate national and local agricultural strategy, created ongoing capacity for performance tracking, enhanced consultation processes, and increased the capacity of ministries to coordinate agricultural policies in Ethiopia, bridging effectiveness gaps. These are key enablers for sustained transformation.
 [Accountability Structure] The Nigerian ATA model also includes a ""bottom-top approach"" to engender accountability and delivery of results.","[Government Crowding Out] The government in Ethiopia crowds out private sector leadership, hindering transformation. The state's financial and institutional support primarily went to conventional Green Revolution seed research and development, sidelining other policies.
 [Scaling Challenges] Green niche actors scaling through the regime structures in Ethiopia do not control how innovations are scaled, which can impair quality and lead to implementation in inappropriate ways. The regime maintains the power to ""filter"" scaled approaches, unlikely to scale those challenging their narrative.

Academic Literature,Catalytic Impact,"[Mandate for Catalysis] The creation of the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) in Ethiopia was instrumental, being a semi-autonomous development agency with the mandate to accelerate agricultural transformation by testing new technology and institutional arrangements. Similarly, the Nigerian ATA's vision is to achieve a hunger-free nation by driving income growth, accelerating food and nutritional security, generating employment, transforming the country into a global player, and growing wealth for farmers.
 [Improved Capacity & Coordination] In Ethiopia, the ATA enabled a clearer and more effective process to coordinate national and local agricultural strategies, created ongoing capacity for performance tracking, improved consultation processes, and increased the capacity of ministries to coordinate agricultural policies.","[Weak Institutional Capacity] Institutional capabilities are often poor to implement existing policies and laws effectively. Ethiopia has shown weak civil-service effectiveness scores. 
 [Weak Private Sector Participation] The private sector's participation in Nigeria is constrained by lack of political will from the government and a weak institutional structure, high costs, taxes, lack of energy, and multiplicity of taxes. The increasing rate of withdrawal of manufacturing companies from backward integrated agricultural ventures is not a good signal.
 [Niche Strategy Limitations] Green niche actors are pursuing an ""insertion"" strategy (adapting to existing rules) rather than ""mobilization"" (challenging dominant practices). Prospects for a sustainable agricultural transformation do not look very promising under current conditions; adaptation on current trajectories is more likely than fundamental transformation. Regime approval is practically necessary for niche actors to maintain operations.","[Learning from Others] Studying successful transformations in countries like Thailand, India, Vietnam, Morocco, Mexico, Peru, and the USA provides lessons on the importance of political stability, consistent policies, strong public investment, access to finance, market development, private sector role, and adaptation/mitigation strategies – factors that enable successful catalytic impact.
 [Incentivizing Private Sector] The new ATA in Nigeria presents opportunities for abundant investment funds and private investor participation. Suggested pathways for success include providing incentives like land tax exemptions or lower credit to stimulate private investment. Private sector agents can also link smallholder farmers to markets effectively. Contract farming models, where companies provide support, offer opportunities for private sector catalytic engagement.",[Vested Elite Interests] The state and elite's vested interest in maintaining the status quo (seen as resource extraction) is a major barrier to inclusive and equitable transformation.
