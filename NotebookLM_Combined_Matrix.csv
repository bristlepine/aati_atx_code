Academic Lit,Governance,"[Government Commitment] Countries committed to agricultural transformation will increase spending to drive transformation. The head of state and other top leaders showing high commitment to transformation is necessary for true change. Agricultural policy driven by evidence more than politics is crucial.

[Effective Plan Building Blocks] An agricultural plan that has several basic building blocks is a critical component for effectiveness.

[Policy Stability] Demonstrated commitment to policy stability is critical to support agricultural transformation.

[High Political Priority] In Ethiopia, agricultural transformation goals were already a high priority for the government in 2000, and this shifted to high performance by 2005. Leadership was able to refocus on Agricultural Development Led Industrialization (ADLI) after the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, and the subsequent Prime Minister continued to emphasize agriculture as a key driver.

[Plan Quality Improvement] The quality of Ethiopia's agricultural development plan, including clearer priorities, measurable targets, cost estimates, and specific gender strategies, jumped in 2002.

[National-Local Alignment] The Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) in Ethiopia enabled a clearer and more effective process to align central and local agricultural strategies.

[Inter-Ministerial Coordination] The ATA increased the capacity of ministries to coordinate agricultural policies in Ethiopia. Expert opinion on ministerial coordination capacity was low in the early 2000s but improved with recent interministerial coordination meetings.","[Low Leadership Support] Leaders often lacked transformation training, access to good analytics, and a mentor network.

[Stakeholder Misalignment] Key stakeholders at the national level (ministries, private sector, civil society) often fail to come together and align priorities. There is also a vertical misalignment of different layers of government (national, state, and local), putting transformation progress at risk.

[Hard-to-Measure Shifts] Readiness for transformation depends on hard-to-measure shifts in political commitment and institutional innovation.

[Civil Service Weakness] Ethiopia showed weak civil-service effectiveness scores across all periods, though the ATA helped bridge gaps.

[Private Sector Coordination Challenges] There have been historical challenges incorporating the private sector in Ethiopia, though a coordination mechanism is now in place.","[Policy Direction] Farmers should be given guidance and training on how to make decisions about commercialization, rather than specific instructions on which crops to grow and sell.","[Political Turnover] Political turnover is an external risk that could undermine ATx models.

Academic Lit,Financing,"[High Government Expenditure] Countries committed to agricultural transformation will increase spending to drive transformation. Ethiopia showed moderate performance in government expenditure on agriculture in 2000.

[Budget Disbursement Capacity] High percentage of agricultural budget disbursed indicates that countries committed to transformation follow through on budgetary commitments. Ethiopia showed good capacity for disbursement, exceeding targets for extension services and fertilizer distribution, with over 95% of the budget disbursed in 2013.

[Quality of Expenditure] A high percentage of the budget spent on enablers such as infrastructure, R&D, and building human capital facilitates transformation more than subsidies.","[Expenditure Quality Data Gap] For Ethiopia, historical data on how much of the agricultural budget was spent on transformation enablers (like research and infrastructure versus subsidies) was not available.",[Investment Funds] There are opportunities to secure abundant investment funds.,,Boettiger et al 2017.pdf; Minot el al 2022.pdf
Academic Lit,Institutional Anchoring,"[Autonomous Agency Creation] The creation of the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) in 2010 streamlined coordination of transformation activities and increased the talent pool. The ATA provided a better foundation on which to build the right policies and investments for agricultural transformation.

[Foundational Shift] The critical importance of the ATA stands out as shifting foundational political, institutional, and organizational aspects in Ethiopia's early stages of transformation.","[Government Crowding Out] Government crowding out the private sector leadership is an obstacle to transformation. Heavy government presence may have slowed the rise of the private sector in Ethiopia.

[Lack of Responsible Org] There is no single organization (including the Ministry of Agriculture, ATA, or Ethiopian Agricultural Business Corporation) directly responsible for, or dedicated to, supporting agricultural mechanization or rural transformation.

[Path Dependency] Agricultural modernization path dependencies and incumbent powers for top-down control of farmers have contributed to the lack of inclusive and equitable seed sector development in Ethiopia.

[State Control Motive] The regime's predominant focus on supplying agricultural inputs, including certified seeds, through public institutions is linked to its instrument for securing political control of rural constituencies.

[Developmental State Overriding] The developmental state model in Ethiopia overrides donors’ neoliberal conditionalities to implement a competitive free market economy.","[Youth Protest Influence] Widespread youth protest between 2015 and 2018 brought a ""reformist"" Prime Minister (Abiy Ahmed) to power, leading to optimism about liberalization and privatization of Ethiopia’s agri-food system, including the seed sector.",,Boettiger et al 2017.pdf; Diriba 2018.pdf; Mulesa 2021.pdf
Academic Lit,Stakeholder Coordination,"[Cross-Sector Consultation] A consultation process across government, donors, and the private sector is a key enabler of agricultural transformation.

[Improved Consultation] In Ethiopia, the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) improved the consultation process across government, donors, and the private sector.","[Stakeholder Misalignment] Key stakeholders at the national level (including leaders from different ministries, the private sector, and civil society) often fail to align priorities in a detailed way. There is also a vertical misalignment of different layers of government (national, state, and local), which can put the progress of transformations at risk.","[Government Collaboration] Green niche actors view working with the government, particularly the agricultural extension system, as one of the main opportunities for having a sustained impact across scales.

[Enhanced Tracking] The Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) in Ethiopia created ongoing capacity for performance tracking of the country’s agricultural strategy.

[Evidence-Based Policy] The ability to make evidence-based policy requires good agriculture sector data.

[Adaptation Willingness] Subsequent development plans in Ethiopia acknowledged shortcomings/challenges of prior plans, indicating a willingness to adapt strategy based on evidence.","[Poor Analytics Access] Leaders often lacked access to good analytics.

[Tracking Challenges] Ethiopia's Welfare Monitoring System, in place since the mid-1990s, faced implementation challenges for several decades.","[Knowledge & Skills Access] Accessing the knowledge and skills embodied in technologies and management practices is a systemic trigger for transformation.

[Online Learning] The traditional extension system needs to be complemented or even replaced by online learning and private sector agricultural extension services.

[Big Data Application] Consideration should be given to rolling out the application of Internet and big data to allow for accurate estimates of demand for agricultural inputs, spatially and temporally.

Academic Lit,Political–Managerial Balance,"[Head of State Priority] Agricultural transformation being a high priority of the head of state and other top leaders is essential for true change to occur.

[High Political Priority] In Ethiopia, the goals of agricultural transformation were already a high priority for the government in 2000, shifting to high performance by 2005. Leadership could refocus on ADLI after the war, and the subsequent Prime Minister continued emphasis on agriculture.

[Policy Flexibility] A government's ability to modify its strategies and implementation approach as an agricultural transformation moves ahead is a critical essential enabler.

[Evidence-Based Policy Making] Transformation relies on decision-makers being open to external policy expertise to shape strategy (especially subsidies, tariffs, land, and irrigation) based on evidence.","[Low Leadership Support] One commonly absent component of transformation readiness relates to low support for transformation leadership, with leaders often lacking transformation training, access to good analytics, and a mentor network for support and practical advice.",,"[Political Turnover] Political turnover is an external risk that could undermine ATx models.

[Long-Term Challenges] Ethiopia likely faces some long-term challenges to maintain momentum in later stages of agricultural transformation, requiring continued investment in expensive projects such as rural electrification and roads, and increased private sector engagement.

[Endowment Gaps] The framework for transformation readiness is not comprehensive and notably omits critical determinants like land rights, access to markets, and agroecological endowments, which require longer time and significant additional resources to change. Management of population growth and government approach to family planning are also critical omitted factors.",,[Climate Shocks] Climate shocks are external risks or pressures that could undermine the ATx model’s functioning or objectives.,Boettiger et al 2017.pdf; Diriba 2018.pdf; Jaernberg et al 2018.pdf
Academic Lit,Catalytic Impact,"[Poverty Reduction Catalyst] Agricultural transformation lies at the core of poverty reduction, food security, and improved nutrition. Countries that have moved toward middle-income status have been initially driven by the transformation of their agriculture sector.

[Large Economic Impact] In India, addressing key agriculture sector constraints could create an increase in agricultural output of $175 billion and an 85% average increase in farmers’ incomes by 2025.

[Rural Economic Growth] Successful agricultural transformations can rapidly reduce poverty because they create powerful engines of rural economic growth.

[Productivity & Market Demand] The dynamics of an agricultural transformation start with increasing rural household income, higher productivity on farms, and greater demand in local markets.

[Ethiopia Success Story] Ethiopia’s path through the first stages of a national agricultural transformation is a sub-Saharan African success story, with many countries looking to the Ethiopian example for lessons. Ethiopia showed solid signs of agricultural transformation, including increased agricultural productivity and poverty reduction, between 2000 and 2015.

[Enhanced Policy Impact] Ethiopia’s government made critical institutional, organizational, and political changes that increased the impact of its early-stage agricultural transformation policies and investments. The ATA enabled a clearer and more effective process to align central and local agricultural strategies, created ongoing capacity for performance tracking, improved consultation, and increased ministerial coordination capacity.","[Stalled Transformation] Many countries remain stalled in their journey toward agricultural transformation. Despite national efforts, the number of poor and food-insecure people in Ethiopia remains very high, with an estimated 25 million at the threshold of survival. The numbers of people on emergency and safety net program assistance have been consistently increasing. Ethiopia's import of cereals, edible oil, and lint cotton continues to rise dramatically, costing over a billion dollars every year, despite these products potentially being homegrown.

[Growth Without Transformation] Ethiopia has registered rapid, broad-based, and inclusive economic growth (averaging 10% per annum) and a substantial decline in monetary poverty. However, the multi-dimensional poverty index remains very high (83.5%). The government self-assessment admitted ""limitation in terms of structural change"" and that ""there had been no structural change at all"". Increases in output growth have often been due to area expansion rather than yield increase per unit area.

[Uneven Gains] Accelerated transformation has occurred at the national level but with uneven gains along ethnic/geographic lines. There are growing divisions and inequalities between the rich and the poor, those with and without land access, different generations, genders, and between well-connected and less well-connected communities.

[Traditional System Acceptance] Ethiopia seems to have accepted its traditional system of agricultural production as the best available.

[Limited Scale for Smallholders] Increase in crop productivity is certainly necessary but insufficient to produce all-inclusive agricultural transformation.","[Productivity Increase Potential] Ethiopia has the potential to substantially increase pulse crop yields, even doubling current yields. The livestock sector also has huge potential to transform into an economic engine for households and the nation.

[Mechanization Imperative] Replacing the ox-plow and manual agricultural production practices with mechanized systems is the ""sine qua non"" of agricultural transformation.

[High Value Crops] Commercial crops generate higher returns per hectare than staple food crops, which can drive income and welfare improvement.","[High Imports] Ethiopia's import of cereals, edible oil, and lint cotton continues to rise dramatically, costing over a billion dollars every year.",Boettiger et al 2017.pdf; Diriba 2018.pdf; Minot el al 2022.pdf
KII FGD,Governance,"[Unique Setup] ATI's unique setup, including the ability to conduct studies and lead implementation of large-scale projects, has been crucial.

[Autonomy from Government] Moving to large programs like ACC provided ATI with a degree of autonomy from the government due to its own budget.

[Integrated Operations] Deep integration into the agricultural sector through large programs made it more difficult to discontinue ATI's work.

[Shared Hosting] ATO is hosted by both the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries.

[Government Staff Secondment] Most ATO staff (98% are seconded from the Ministries), fostering integration.

[Ministry as Implementer] The ministries are the main implementers of the master plan, with ATO coordinating.

[Political Will] The Minister's request and active championship, stemming from a direct government need, was the biggest factor in early success.

[Minister's Influence] The Minister of Agriculture in Tanzania is influential due to passion, farming experience, popularity, and presidential prioritization of agriculture.

[PM Sponsorship] Ethiopia ATA's success was linked to strong prime ministerial sponsorship and a centrally controlled government at the time.

[Transformation Council] The Transformation Council, chaired by the prime minister and including ministers from various sectors, ensured cross-ministerial coordination.

[AATI Multi-Partner Structure] AATI's central governance involves a partnership between Gates Foundation, IFAD, McKenzie, and Agra, with a steering committee.

[IFAD Fiduciary Role] IFAD serves as the fiduciary responsible for grant implementation for AATI, with strategic direction from the steering committee.

[Partner Contribution Clarity] Partnership work requires clear alignment of each institution's contributions, established before grant approval.

[Demand-Driven Approach] AATI's demand-driven approach works solely on expressed country requirements.

[Political Weight of Minister] The political drive and weight of the Minister of Agriculture within the government are crucial for an ATX to gain traction.

[Clarity of Vision] Clarity of vision and clear objectives are key factors for ATX success.

[Civil Servant Buy-in] Buy-in from civil servants is crucial as they are the ultimate implementers of transformation.

[PM Backing] Strong backing of the then Prime Minister was a crucial factor for ATA's early traction.

[Independent Structure] ATA had an independent structure while reporting to the Transformation Council led by the Prime Minister, ensuring close follow-up and quick decision-making.

[Cross-Sector Council] The Transformation Council included ministers and senior advisors looking into large national flagship programs across agriculture and other sectors.

[Accountability] The initial ATA design addressed accountability mechanisms.

[Political Support] ATI received political support needed from the top level down to the district level as a government institution.

[Structural Alignment] Good structure with steering committees at higher levels (national, regional) and zonal coordinators helps align stakeholders.

[Value Chain Alliance Meetings] Quarterly ""value chain alliance meetings"" gather all stakeholders (processors, input providers, research, private sector) to discuss challenges and share responsibilities.

[Implementation Support Staff] ATI has implementation support staff (DU units) in different institutions and across regions, acting as ambassadors to scale initiatives and influence policy.

[Collaborative Approach] ATI doesn't work alone; all stakeholders along the value chain participate.

[PM/Ministerial Leadership] The national steering committee was primarily led by the Prime Minister, now by the Ministry of Agriculture.

[Professional Institution] ATI is a professional institution, ""free from politics,"" which helps maintain its influence during political transitions.","[Leadership Authority Confusion] When leadership (AATI) went to the Minister and bypassed the Director or Permanent Secretary, it put the ATO Director in a ""very tricky situation"".

[Political Position Vulnerability] The Minister's position is political and can change anytime, posing a risk to continuity.

[Misaligned External Communication] Poor communication between AATI and the government exacerbated issues, creating internal conflicts and a ""toxic environment"".

[Forced Defense] The ATO Director, as a Tanzanian employed by an international organization (AATI), felt forced to defend AATI even when facing challenges on the ground, sometimes having to ""lie"".

[Ministry Tension] The Ethiopian ATA model created tension with the Ministry of Agriculture, which perceived duplication of roles until ATA demonstrated impact.

[Problem-Solving Process Gap] AATI's multi-partner governance lacked a clearer process for problem-solving and decision-making within the partnership.

[PS Resistance] Resistance from the Ministry, particularly the Permanent Secretary (PS), regarding operational aspects (office space, equipment) emerged after ATO launch.

[Role Confusion] The PS's resistance led to confusion about roles and a ""grab"" for control.

[Late PS Involvement] The PS's late involvement in discussions led to safeguards and limitations on recruitment and activities, hindering progress.

[Political Maze] Tanzania got caught in a ""political maze"" that made it difficult to align political and programmatic parts.

[Dual Reporting Lines] The direct hiring model (EAT contracts) for ATO staff created dual reporting lines for the director (political with ministry, programmatic with AATI).

[Existing Structure Resistance] Challenges stemmed from existing structures within the Ministry of Agriculture and research institutes, who perceived ATA's role as redundant, leading to resistance and complex power dynamics.

[No Grassroots Implementation] ATA lacked its own implementation structures at the grassroots level, requiring reliance on federal and regional agricultural offices, causing initial delays.

[Reporting Structure Shift] The transfer of ATI to report directly to the Ministry of Agriculture made it ""no more a threat,"" but questions whether that's a good or bad thing.

[Stakeholder Management] Stakeholder management is a major challenge due to needing to create ""web"" and requiring smooth alignment.

[Cross-Ministerial Coordination] Inter-ministerial coordination is a difficulty.",,"[Discontinuation Risk] If ATI had remained a ""think tank"" with small-scale projects, it would have been very easy to write it off and discontinue its work.

[Inter-Agency Power Dynamics] The new master plan created fears among employees of existing programs (like ASDP2) about job security at the parliamentary level, requiring extensive engagement and advocacy.

[Political Changes] Political changes (e.g., elections) can lead to changes in leadership, potentially undermining established initiatives.

[Donor Reservation] ATI's status as a government institution (even if donor-supported) might affect donor partners' reservations during political shifts. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------","""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & ATI Director Rodrigues) - 2025/06/02 07:55 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & ATO Director Missokia) - 2025/06/03 06:49 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & Dr Mengistu/BMGF) - 2025/06/03 08:57 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & Safia) - 2025/05/22 07:59 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study interview (Bristlepine & WFP ETH) - 2025/06/02 06:58 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""Focus Group Discussion on Ethiopia ATI - 2025/06/11 06:28 EDT - Notes by Gemini"""
KII FGD,Financing,"[Donor Supported Studies] Studies are cost-effective due to donor support, leading to near-zero marginal cost for additional studies.

[Effective Resource Mobilization] The ability to effectively mobilize resources from donors was crucial for the shift to large-scale programs and the ATI's growth.

[Pooled Funding Advantage] ATI's credibility allows it to attract pooled funding for programs rather than being reactive to individual donor project preferences, giving it more autonomy in shaping its work.

[Catalytic Flexible Funding] Gates Foundation's funding to both ATA and AATI has been catalytic and flexible, allowing for revisions based on startup needs.

[Leveraging Other Resources] Catalystic funding enabled ATA to leverage significant resources from other donors.

[Catalytic Funding] Clear financing that is catalytic for an AT model is very important, allowing the government not to seek funds for the model itself.

[Foundation's Funding] The Foundation's funding is considered ""very lucky"" in providing catalytic support.","[Donor Dependency Risk] When 90% of the budget comes from donors, there's a risk of ""doing what they want"" and falling into a trap of donor-driven agendas.

[Resource Delays] Lack of timely financial and technical resources and delays in resource availability impacted ATO's ability to fulfill promises, leading to a loss of credibility.

[Operational Funding Gaps] Limited funds for operational activities like meeting allowances forced the ATO to emphasize ""value of information"" over financial incentives.

[Misaligned Funding Expectations] Initial high expectations from government officials for immediate direct financial support from ATO led to credibility loss when unfulfilled. This was exacerbated by a ""donor support syndrome"".

[Accountability vs. Flexibility] While flexible, Gates Foundation funding comes with accountability and alignment with strategic priorities, differentiating it from general operating support.

[Taxpayer Accountability] Gates Foundation's flexibility is partly due to not having the same accountability to taxpayers as governmental organizations like USAID.

[Funding Obstacles] Government reliance on external funding can lead to delays if funds get stuck in arbitration with the Ministry of Finance or Treasury.

[Resource Complaints] Significant complaints about lack of funds for fuel, meeting attendance, and daily subsistence allowance (DSA) were prevalent in Tanzania ATO.

[Underinvestment] Despite agriculture's importance (32-35% of GDP), Ethiopia's investment (5-6%) is below the 10% required by CADUP.

[Capital Funding Needs] ATI needs a ""huge amount of capital funding"" to achieve its goals in the large agricultural sector.

[Input Cost Fluctuations] Fluctuating prices of imported inputs like fertilizers and agrochemicals affect adoption by farmers.",,"[Donor Fluctuations] The analytics program's resilience is partly due to reduced dependence on external experts and donor fluctuations.

KII FGD,Institutional Anchoring,"[Ministry Integration] ATI originated as the analytics unit within the Ministry of Agriculture, evolving to work increasingly across other government ministries.

[Established Affiliation] ATI is an affiliated institution of the Ministry of Agriculture, reporting directly to it.

[Cross-Sector Utility] ATI has become ""useful beyond agriculture,"" working with other ministries like irrigation, labor and skills, and finance, demonstrating its value across government.

[Master Plan Embedding] Embedding the master plan within the ministries' systems (e.g., M&E, IT) is crucial for sustainability and mitigating political disruptions.

[Ministerial Ownership] The master plan is managed by both agriculture-related ministries, fostering a greater sense of ownership than previous plans under the Prime Minister's Office.

[Delivery Mechanism Focus] AATI is a central unit supporting country-level delivery mechanisms (ATOs).

[Beyond MoA Engagement] AATI hopes ATOs work beyond just the Ministry of Agriculture, utilizing structures like working groups for coordination.

[Government Institution] ATI is seen as a government institution, which lends it significant weight.

[Ministry Collaboration] ATI ensured the Ministry of Agriculture took the lead and ownership in representing ATI and its work, fostering sustainability.

[Government Institution] ATI is a government institution but with a more competitive operational structure than typical government institutions.

[Expanded Mandate] ATI has an additional mandate to conduct independent assessments and surveys, giving it more ""freedom"".","[Name Change Semantics] The name change from ATA to ATI was primarily due to government reforms distinguishing regulatory bodies (agencies) from other institutions (institutes), with no change in core mandate but potentially semantic confusion.

[Reporting Structure History] Historically, while there's a belief ATI reported to the PM's office, Fernando expresses doubts, stating it was always an affiliated institution of the Ministry of Agriculture.

[Legal Terminology] Terminology like ""agency"" can have legal implications depending on a country's stage of development, potentially starting with a ""unit"" or ""office"" before a legally established ""agency"".

[Diluted Ownership] The shift to ATO staff holding EAT contracts potentially diluted government ownership compared to a grantee model.

[Infrastructure Limitations] Infrastructure limitations in rural areas (roads, electricity) pose major bottlenecks.

[Legal Identity Needs] Farmers in ACC need legal identity, which is a bottleneck affecting production and productivity.

[Research Focus Shift] ATI's role is now more focused on conducting research through studies rather than practical, experimental research on the ground.","[Tailored Terminology] Adapting terminology (""unit,"" ""office,"" ""institute,"" ""agency"") based on country's maturity and political engagement is the best approach.",[Security Challenges] Security challenges are an internal but significant bottleneck. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------,"""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & ATI Director Rodrigues) - 2025/06/02 07:55 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & ATO Director Missokia) - 2025/06/03 06:49 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & Dr Mengistu/BMGF) - 2025/06/03 08:57 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & Safia) - 2025/05/22 07:59 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study interview (Bristlepine & WFP ETH) - 2025/06/02 06:58 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""Focus Group Discussion on Ethiopia ATI - 2025/06/11 06:28 EDT - Notes by Gemini"""
KII FGD,Stakeholder Coordination,"[Cross-Ministerial Coordination] The Ethiopian ATA's governance model included a Transformation Council chaired by the prime minister and involving ministers from various sectors (such as trade, transportation, and finance), which was key to ensuring cross-ministerial coordination necessary for agricultural advancement.

[Relationship Management] Strong relationship management and stakeholder engagement are highlighted as crucial non-financial aspects for focusing on the common good and effectively driving initiatives forward.

[Early Results Build Credibility] Achieving early, visible results (e.g., in direct seed marketing or soil mapping) was critical for the Ethiopian ATA to build credibility and momentum, demonstrating its value to the sector and helping to manage initial tensions with existing government structures.

[Inter-Ministerial Ownership] The government's ownership, particularly from both the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, was a significant factor in the ATO's early success, as the initiative stemmed from their direct request to enhance delivery unit capacity. The agriculture master plan being managed by both agriculture-related ministries (rather than solely under the Prime Minister's Office as with previous plans) fostered a greater sense of ownership and improved coordination.

[Ministry Support during Crisis] Even when the ATO faced severe internal challenges and resource limitations, the commitment from the ministry to the transformation agenda and their active support (e.g., providing working tools, engaging with other partners like the World Bank and Agra on behalf of the ATO) were crucial in sustaining efforts.

[Collaborative Alignment] The ATO successfully collaborated with development partners such as Agra, the World Bank, and the Norwegian government by aligning the new agriculture master plan with existing initiatives like ASDP2, which helped to secure their continued support for the broader agenda.

[Unified Data System] A notable achievement was the development of a data management system within the Ministry of Agriculture, which harmonized data and information across various departments. This significantly improved coordination within the ministry and has been positively recognized, including in parliamentary sessions.

[Clear Communication Protocol] A clear communication protocol was established, stipulating that external communication requests intended for the Minister or Permanent Secretary should be channeled through the ATO within the country. This defined responsibility for stakeholder engagement and streamlined interactions.","[Partnership Decision Process] The AATI's multi-partner governance structure, involving the Gates Foundation, IFAD, McKenzie, and Agra, lacked a clear process for problem-solving and decision-making within the partnership, despite initial alignment on each institution's contributions.

[Misaligned Expectations] The ATO faced significant challenges due to initial high expectations from government officials for the ATO to provide immediate direct financial support, partly stemming from prior promises made before the ATO's involvement. This led to a loss of credibility when the ATO could not fulfill these expectations, requiring active engagement and repeated presentations to clarify its coordinating and resource mobilization role. This was exacerbated by a ""donor support syndrome"" where large donors were perceived as direct funding sources.

[Inter-Agency Power Dynamics] The introduction of the new agriculture master plan created challenges at the parliamentary level, including fears among employees of existing programs (like ASDP2) about job security. This required extensive engagement, persuasion, and advocacy through various steering committees to ensure understanding and collaboration between the new and existing initiatives.

[Resource-Driven Coordination Lags] Practical coordination was hampered by limited funds for operational activities like meeting allowances. This forced the ATO to frequently emphasize the intrinsic ""value of information"" over financial incentives to encourage participation from stakeholders.

[External Communication Breakdown] Poor communication between AATI (the external support entity) and the government exacerbated internal issues and significantly hindered the ATO's effectiveness. This created internal conflicts and contributed to a ""toxic environment"".

[Erosion of Morale] A combination of structural, systemic, and leadership issues, compounded by internal conflicts and the ATO's inability to deliver effectively due to external hindrances, led to a significant drop in staff morale and the loss of valuable team members. This created a very challenging internal environment for coordination and progress.","[Vertical & Horizontal Coordination] AATI aims for in-country Agricultural Transformation Offices (ATOs) to expand their work beyond just the Ministry of Agriculture, leveraging structures like working groups to ensure vertical and horizontal coordination across relevant ministries and sub-national levels in different country contexts.

[Leveraging Analytical Skills] McKenzie's analytical skills and pro bono support were instrumental in conducting assessments for the Ethiopian ATA model and exploring potential structures, proving to be a valuable resource for expanding the ATA approach to other countries.

KII FGD,Catalytic Impact,"[Studies & Implementation Capacity] ATI's ability to conduct studies and lead implementation of large-scale projects has been crucial for impact.

[ACC as Turning Point] The Agriculture Commercialization Clusters (ACC) program was a key turning point for ATI's success, growth, and impact, shifting its focus to large-scale implementation.

[Leveraging Government Infrastructure] ATI partners with the government, leveraging its access to development agents across the country to implement programs at scale, which NGOs typically cannot do.

[Proactive Program Shaping] ATI's ability to define and shape large-scale programs (like ACC) from the outset and seek pooled funding from multiple donors gives it autonomy and moves it from reactive to proactive engagement.

[Donor Strategy Integration] ATI can co-create and integrate its programs into donor country strategies, as seen with Denmark making ACC2 its main agricultural investment.

[Prioritization] Importance of prioritization to address lack of focus in national strategies.

[Problem-Solving Focus] ATA aimed to address coordination, evidence-based policy, implementation, and accountability.

[Pilot to Demonstration] The ATA model was piloted in Ethiopia, proved successful, and is now being demonstrated in other countries through AATI.

[Breaking Down Plans] Importance of breaking down large plans into manageable pieces and showing early results.

[Effective Delivery Mindsets] Effective delivery mindsets and skills are crucial for achieving results.

[Beyond Paper Results] Necessity to show ""some successes"" beyond just papers or strategies.

[Two-Pronged Approach] AATI's two-pronged approach involves co-designing an actionable agricultural transformation plan and structuring a delivery support plan.

[ATO as Instrument] The ATO is designed as the instrument to help advance the agricultural transformation agenda.

[Agriculture Plan Development] Tanzania ATO played a key role in developing an agricultural development plan by breaking down the country's 2050 vision into 15 flagships through stakeholder consultations.

[Political Tool] The developed plan serves as a ""working document as a political tool"" to guide agricultural growth.

[Problem-Solving Focus] ATA's problem-solving approach and focus on smallholder farmers were significant contributions.

[Direct Seed Marketing] Direct seed marketing system was a transformative innovation making seeds widely available.

[Market-Driven Production] Introduction of a market-driven production concept was a huge philosophical shift, linking farmers to buyers and creating demand.

[Market Linkages] Establishment of market linkages (e.g., malt barley) connected farmers directly with buyers, improving quality and investment.

[Private Sector Facilitation] ATA facilitated and tested technologies with smallholder farmers for the private sector, leveraging the government extension system.

[Research Commercialization] ATA linked research institutions with SMEs to commercialize existing agricultural innovations.

[Operational Focus] ATI initially focused on operations to turn its mandate into specific actions and provide diagnostic support.

[Innovative & Scalable Projects] Innovative projects designed based on studies are implemented only if adopted and scalable.

[ACC Impact] The Agricultural Commercialization Clusters (ACC) program brings significant changes by focusing on the entire value chain and engaging the private sector, contributing to GDP.

[Both Policy & Solutions] ATI's catalytic impact comes from both influencing government policy and finding creative solutions for smallholder farmers.

[Policy Development] ATI plays a role in developing agricultural policies (e.g., agriculture and rural development policy).

[Project Implementation] ATI itself implements innovative ideas that the Ministry of Agriculture can then take up nationally.

[Projects Show Impact] Projects are most important for demonstrating impact at the ground level and building trust with farmers and partners (e.g., input voucher system).

[Regional Roadmaps] ATI develops regional roadmaps aligned with local focus commodities.

[Private Sector Investment] Efforts to attract private sector investment and promote contract farming are crucial for commercialization.

[Government Adoption] The government's adoption and scaling up of ATI's cluster farming model across the country demonstrates significant impact.

[Systemic Integration] ATI focuses on systemic integrations and linking institutions for synergy and excellence.","[Small-Scale Limitations] Previously, ATI engaged in many ""small projects"" that were ""a bit all over the place"", often driven by donor preferences rather than coherent programs.

[Think Tank Limitations] If ATI were merely a think tank, its papers and policies would likely be unsolicited and have weak connection to government priorities, leading to dim acceptance.

[NGO Limitations] As an NGO, it would be difficult to run projects engaging ""millions and millions of farmers"" due to limitations in scale and leveraging government infrastructure.

[Disjointed Policymaking] A common challenge is disjointed policymaking not based on evidence and data.

[Weak Implementation] Weak implementation capacity was identified as a cross-cutting issue.

[Implementation Delays] Lack of resources early on prevented the ATO from implementing activities, leading to broken promises and loss of credibility with the government.

[Limited Master Plan Launch] The agriculture master plan was never officially launched, limiting ATO's achievements despite related activities.

[Limited Impact on Ground] The ""toxic environment"" and inability to deliver effectively hindered ATO's impact on the ground.

[Limited Achievements] The ATO's progress was hindered, leading to ""very empty"" reporting to donors on results framework.",[Youth Component] Integrating a youth component and including youth representatives can provide valuable insights and further develop case studies.,[Premature Criticism] Caution against being overly critical of AATI at this early stage; focus should be on expediting startup and implementation.,"""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & ATI Director Rodrigues) - 2025/06/02 07:55 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & ATO Director Missokia) - 2025/06/03 06:49 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & Dr Mengistu/BMGF) - 2025/06/03 08:57 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study Interview (Bristlepine & Safia) - 2025/05/22 07:59 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""ATx study interview (Bristlepine & WFP ETH) - 2025/06/02 06:58 EDT - Notes by Gemini""; ""Focus Group Discussion on Ethiopia ATI - 2025/06/11 06:28 EDT - Notes by Gemini"""
