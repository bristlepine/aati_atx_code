◦
[External Communication Breakdown] Poor communication between AATI (the external support entity) and the government exacerbated internal issues and significantly hindered the ATO's effectiveness. This created internal conflicts and contributed to a "toxic environment".
◦
[Erosion of Morale] A combination of structural, systemic, and leadership issues, compounded by internal conflicts and the ATO's inability to deliver effectively due to external hindrances, led to a significant drop in staff morale and the loss of valuable team members. This created a very challenging internal environment for coordination and progress.
